# UnShort
Just a simple Chrome extension that hides all shorts on YouTube and also redirects shorts to the regular video player. In addition the extension displays how much time
you have spent watching YouTube.

## Why
I was spending too much time doom scrolling through shorts leaving me too little time for coding. As a result, I created this extension so that I don't watch shorts and can keep track of how much time I have spent on YouTube.
